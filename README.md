# Data-Cleaning

Level : Beginner

In this guided project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the datasets for TAFE exit survey and DETE exut survey in the repository itself. 
I tried to analyse resignations due to dissastisfaction according to the age, experience and time worked at the company.

Although this was part of a Guided project from Dataquest, I tried to analyse and clean the dataset by referring to various data cleaning projects and implementing thosw findings in my projects.
